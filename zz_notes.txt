## docker prune is used to remove all unused container

## unlike docker volume docker network command won't create the containers automatically

## command to create new network
sudo docker network create network1

## this network will ensure that we don't need to hardcode the ip adress details 

## after adding a network in url instead of localhost we can keep other container name which we want to access
